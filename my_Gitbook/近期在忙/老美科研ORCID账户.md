## Your 16-digit ORCID identifier is 0000-0003-3917-2080, and your full ORCID iD and the link to your public record is [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-2080](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-2080)

Next steps:

**1\. Add more information to your ORCID Record**

Access your ORCID record at [https://orcid.org/my-orcid](https://orcid.org/my-orcid) and add more information to your record. If you haven't already done so, we strongly recommend that you add more than one email address to your account, since our system checks names and email addresses to prevent the creation of duplicate records.   
  
Funders, publishers, universities, and others use the information contained in your ORCID record to help reduce the record-keeping they ask from you. Increase the information you can share by adding other names you are known by, professional information such as your affiliation, biography, and keywords, funding you have received, and works you have created or contributed to your record.   
  
See our tips for [six things to do now that you have an ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/blog/2015/07/23/six-things-do-now-you%E2%80%99ve-got-orcid-id). For tips on adding information to your ORCID record see: [https://support.orcid.org/hc/articles/360006896894](https://support.orcid.org/hc/articles/360006896894)

**2\. Use your ORCID iD when publishing, applying for grants, and more**

Many systems ask for your ORCID iD in order to create a link between you and your research outputs and affiliations. Using your ORCID iD, and granting organizations permission to update your record whenever they request this will help you get credit for your work and reduce time spent on future record-keeping.
